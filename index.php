Bonuses and Promotions.
Mobile players can benefit from several different promotions and incentives designed to boost their winning potential. Newcomers at Casino Rocket’s in-browser app can take advantage of a lucrative sign-up offer that will cover your first two deposits . If you set up an account at this mobile casino and make a qualifying deposit that amounts to at least $20. It is important to mention that deposits via Skrill and Neteller do not qualify for the Welcome Bonus.
The bonus will double your deposit up to $500 and you will receive 50 free spins on Aztec Magic Deluxe . Provided that this slot game is not available in your country, then you can use the free spins on the slot game Platinum Lightning Deluxe.
If you make a second qualifying deposit of $30 or more, you will receive a 50% match deposit bonus of up to $1,000 and 100 free spins on Aztec Magic Deluxe. The free spins are valid for a week, while the bonus will expire after 14 days after being credited to your account . Each deposit bonus and the winnings from the free spins are tied to a 45x wagering requirement. Once you satisfy the bonus, you will be allowed to pull out your winnings.
However, mobile players should be informed that they can withdraw no more than $50 from their winnings accrued from the free spins. On a more positive note, there is no maximum limit on the withdrawable profits generated from the Welcome Bonus . When navigating your way through the rollover, note that the maximum bet you are allowed to place shall not exceed $5. Another important aspect is the game weighting.
